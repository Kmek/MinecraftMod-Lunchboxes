# Kmek's Lunchboxes Mod

A [Forge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kmeks-lunchboxes) mod that adds a variety of collectible and functional Lunchboxes to Minecraft.

This mod is in progress with more to be added in the future!

Please keep in mind that features are still being implemented in the Alpha stage, so some items might be missing recipes, or change in a future update.

### Note

All textures and models are custom-made by me. They cannot be used elsewhere for free. They cannot be used elsewhere without permission from me. You must consult with me before you use any of my mod's assets.

All rights reserved in this mod, and I allow for this mod to be included in ModPacks. You can look at my source code for learning purposes, but you cannot copy!

## Compatability
- Compiled with **JEI** for crafting recipe support
- Currently focusing on Minecraft **1.19.4** (will work on porting when I have more time)

# What's in the mod?

This mod adds a variety of Lunchbox blocks. 
These blocks can be placed down and clicked to access 12 slots of storage space. 
The lunchbox can be recollected and will keep its inventory, but for balance, only edible food items can be stored in the lunchbox. 

The lunchbox can also be shift + right clicked to open it, displaying the items stored inside.

### Current Lunchboxes: 
- All 16 wool colors
- Creeper
- Overworld
- Nether
- End
